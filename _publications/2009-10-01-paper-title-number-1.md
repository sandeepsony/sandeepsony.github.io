excerpt: 'In this article, multivariate empirical mode decomposition is proposed for damage localization in structures using limited measurements. Multivariate empirical mode decomposition is first used to decompose the acceleration responses into their mono-component modal responses. The major contributing modal responses are then used to evaluate the modal energy for the respective modes. A damage localization feature is proposed by calculating the percentage difference in the modal energies of damaged and undamaged structures, followed by the determination of the threshold value of the feature. The feature of the specific sensor location exceeding the threshold value is finally used to identify the location of structural damage. The proposed method is validated using a suite of numerical and full-scale studies. The validation is further explored using various limited measurement cases for evaluating the feasibility of using a fewer number of sensors to enable cost-effective structural health monitoring. The results show the capability of the proposed method in identifying as minimal as 2% change in global modal parameters of structures, outperforming the existing time–frequency methods to delineate such minor global damage.'
